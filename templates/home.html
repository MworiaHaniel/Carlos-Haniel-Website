  <p class="lead">
    I am an aspiring Electrical Engineer currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering at Western Carolina University, with an expected graduation in May 2025. I previously earned an Associate of Arts in Electrical Engineering from Potomac State College of WVU, where I graduated with a 3.63 GPA. Throughout my studies, I have worked on a variety of projects, including developing AI chatbots, deep learning classifiers, self-driving car simulations, and web applications using technologies like Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and TensorFlow. I gained industry experience as an Engineering Intern at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, where I worked on high-performance RF Parametric Amplifiers and microstrip transmission lines. My skills include programming, data analysis, and laboratory work, with proficiency in tools like PyTorch, React.js, and CST Studio Suite. I am a team player with strong analytical abilities, recognized with several academic honors, and I actively participate in organizations like the National Society of Black Engineers.  </p>
